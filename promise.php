              <h3>We agree on the following...</h3>
              <p>Look, I don't want to screw you and I know you don't want to screw me.  We mutually agree to try and not screw each other over.  You buy the hotdog, I'll feed it to her and give you a picture of it.</p>
              <p>Hotdog-purchase to hotdog-consumption may be an extended wait, your spot is saved in line.</p>
              <p>Love letters that are tasteful, funny, or complimentory will be passed on!  Letters that are not will be moderated.</p>




              <h3>Magic Secret Promise</h3>
              <p>It's just a hotdog.  We get it.  Some people don't.  We promise not to tell any one that we sent photos to you if you promise not to tell any one either.  You may add your photo to the public gallery on this website and still keep this promise.</p>

              <h3>The Handshake</h3>
              <p>The deals made here are generally good natured but are in complete reliance on the participation of my wife who is, in fact, a free person and in no way any type of employee of mine.  She is a partner here, but her participation is most definitely purchased.  We're currently operating on a no refund policy - even if your purchase takes an extended amount of time, never, or ever.</p>



              <p>Continued use of this website is agreeance to this.</p>

              <p>Enjoy!</p>

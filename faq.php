      <h1>FAQ</h1>
      <br />



        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>A website where you can buy my wife, Karen, a hotdog and I'll give you a picture of her eating it.  You can keep it for yourself or show it off to your friends.  You decide.</p>

        <h3>I bought a hotdog, when is she going to eat it?</h3>
        <p>Get in line, Buddy!  This isn't an "immediately stuff a hotdog down Karen's throat" service. (Looking into that.)  Your time will come.</p>

      <h3>What exactly am I buying here?</h3>
      <p>I've bought a pack of hot dogs.  I'll sell you one at the current price of a hotdog on the main page.  Karen eats your hotdog.  I post picture of Karen eating your hotdog in the gallery.</p>


      <h3>Is one enough?</h3>
      <p>No.  By my calculations she'll need a couple of thousand hotdogs.</p>

      <h3>I've already lost hundreds of dollars on meme stock, sell me on a hotdog.</h3>
      <p>Well, my wife loves hotdogs and she'd love to eat yours!</p>

      <h3>So... Is this like a sex thing?</h3>
      <p>How dare you insult our pride!  She is simply eating other peoples hotdogs for a price.</p>

      <h3>So, if you have hotdogs why would I buy them?</h3>
      <p>It's <em>your</em> hotdog.</p>

       <h3>What exactly is a hotdog?</h3>
       <p>According to google: "a frankfurter, especially one served hot in a long, soft roll and topped with various condiments."  Or it can apparently be "a person who shows off, especially a skier or surfer who performs stunts or tricks."  Though getting her to eat your surfer may cost more.</p>

        <h3>Whats the current rate of hotdog consumption?</h3>
        <p>Hotdog consumption varies greatly from multiple hotdogs a day to hotdog dry spells for weeks.  Your orders are queued though and you will be notified by email when your images are uploaded.</p>

        <h3>Can I get a stool sample?</h3>
        <p>Not at this time.</p>

        <h3>Can I make a request or get a personal touch?</h3>
        <p>You may request one, but I cannot ensure Karen will comply with your request.  Feel free, though.</p>

        <h3>Whats the max number of simultaneous dogs in mouth?</h3>
        <p>The limit is theoretically infinite, though she hasn't yet been convinced to simultaneously eat your hotdogs.</p>

        <h3>Did a tree fall on your house?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  Please buy more hotdogs.</p>

        <h3>Do you have any more hotdog eating models?</h3>
        <p>Not at this time.</p>

        <h3>Can I send Karen a personal message?</h3>
        <p>You may send Karen a love letter if you like.  We'll accept the money and I'll show her how to read and reply to the letter.  Tell her anything you want, she loves love letters!  What would a soldier say to his significant other while writing far from home?  You just have to pay me a courier fee.  The higher the bid, the quicker and more likely delivery.</p>

        <h3>When we get a letter, is it really her writing it?</h3>
        <p>I would rather you get nothing than fake it.  The photos you get are unique to your account.  It's part of our security and protection process so we know who let what go public.</p>

        <h3>How do I know it's really my hotdog when I see it?</h3>
        <p>I would rather you get nothing than fake it.</p>

        <h3>Magic Secret Promise</h3>
        <p>It's just a hotdog.  We get it.  Some people don't.  We promise not to tell any one that we sent photos to you if you promise not to tell any one either. mmkay?</p>

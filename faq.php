        <h3>What is this?</h3>
        <p>A fully interactive hot dog experience, currently with high latency.</p>

      <h3>What exactly am I buying here?</h3>
      <p>I've bought a pack of hot dogs.  I'll sell you one at the current price of a hotdog on the main page.  Karen eats your hotdog.  I post picture of Karen eating your hotdog in the gallery.</p>


      <h3>Is one enough?</h3>
      <p>No.  By my calculations she'll need a couple of thousand hotdogs.</p>

      <h3>I've already lost hundreds of dollars on meme stock this week sell me on a hotdog.</h3>
      <p>Well, my wife loves hotdogs and she'd love to eat yours!</p>

      <h3>So... Is this like a sex thing?</h3>
      <p>How dare you insult our pride!  She is simply eating other peoples hotdogs for a price.</p>

      <h3>So, if you have hotdogs why would I buy them?</h3>
      <p>It's <em>your</em> hotdog.</p>

       <h3>What exactly is a hotdog?</h3>
       <p>According to google: "a frankfurter, especially one served hot in a long, soft roll and topped with various condiments."  Or it can apparently be "a person who shows off, especially a skier or surfer who performs stunts or tricks."  Though getting her to eat your surfer may cost more.</p>

        <h3>Whats the current rate of hotdog consumption?</h3>
        <p>Right now, we are at about 1-3 hotdogs a day.  We are looking into ways to improve this.</p>

        <h3>Can I get a stool sample?</h3>
        <p>Not at this time.</p>

        <h3>Can I make a request or get a personal touch?</h3>
        <p>You may request one, but I cannot ensure Karen will comply with your request.  But feel free!</p>

        <h3>Whats the max number of simultaneious dogs in mouth?</h3>
        <p>The limit is theoretically infinite, though she hasn't yet been convinced to simultaniously eat your hotdogs.</p>

        <h3>Did a tree fall on your house?</h3>
        <p>Yes.  Please buy more hotdogs. (It didn't damage much.)</p>

        <h3>Do you have any more hotdog eating models?</h3>
        <p>Not at this time.</p>

        <h3>Can I send Karen a personal message?</h3>
        <p>This is a planned feature, though your message will be subject to moderation before forwarding.</p>

        <h3>I want to send Karen a secret admirer card.</h3>
        <p>Do it!  Here is a link: www</p>

        <h3>I want to buy her valentines flowers!</h3>
        <p>She loves flowers!  You should give them to her.</p>
